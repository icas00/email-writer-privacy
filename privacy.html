  <h1>Privacy Policy for Email Writer</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 2025</p>

  <p>
    Email Writer is a Chrome extension that helps users generate AI-powered email drafts directly within Gmail.
    To provide this functionality, the extension temporarily sends the text you select or type
    (such as your email body or prompt) to a secure backend server where the AI model processes and returns a response.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Handling</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>User input (like email content or tone selection) is transmitted securely to our API for AI generation.</li>
    <li>No personal information is permanently stored or shared with third parties.</li>
    <li>All processing occurs over HTTPS and data is deleted automatically after generating the response.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <p>
    The extension requires limited permissions to interact with Gmailâ€™s compose window,
    save user preferences locally (tone, style), and send requests to the AI API endpoint.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Control</h2>
  <p>
    You may remove the extension at any time from your browser settings.
    Once removed, the extension no longer has access to Gmail or any related data.
