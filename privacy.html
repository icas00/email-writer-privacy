  <h1>Privacy Policy for Email Writer</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 2025</p>

  <p>
    <strong>Email Writer</strong> is a Chrome extension that helps users generate AI-powered email replies directly within Gmail.
    The extension is designed to respect user privacy and collect the minimum data necessary for core functionality.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Collection and Usage</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      When a user requests an AI-generated email reply, the text entered or selected (such as the email body and tone preference)
      is securely transmitted to our backend API for processing.
    </li>
    <li>
      The backend temporarily uses this input to generate a response using a language model, then returns it immediately to the extension.
      No personal data, message content, or generated responses are stored or shared.
    </li>
    <li>
      The extension may use Chrome’s local storage only to save recent generation history for the user’s convenience.
      This data remains entirely on the user’s device and is not transmitted anywhere.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <p>
    The extension uses minimal permissions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Storage</strong> — to save user preferences (e.g., tone and generation history) locally on the device.</li>
    <li><strong>Host permissions</strong> — to communicate securely with Gmail and the AI backend API.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The extension does <strong>not</strong> access or modify your Gmail messages beyond what is necessary to generate replies,
    and does not collect browsing history or personal data.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    All communication between the extension and the backend occurs over secure HTTPS.
    Data sent for processing is ephemeral — it is used only for the duration of the request and then discarded.
  </p>

  <h2>User Control</h2>
  <p>
    You may remove the extension at any time through your browser’s settings. Once removed, it no longer has access to Gmail or any related data.
  </p>
